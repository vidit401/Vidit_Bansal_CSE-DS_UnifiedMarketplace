                            Welcome to Unified Marketplace. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Unified Marketplace website and services. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you should not access or use our services.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: black;">
                            We may modify these Terms at any time, and such modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting on our website. Your continued use of our services after the posting of any modified Terms constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.

                        <p style="color: black;">
                            Unified Marketplace is a product search and comparison platform that aggregates product information from various online retailers. Our service allows you to search for products, compare prices and features, and find links to retailers where you can purchase the products.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color: black;">
                            We do not sell products directly. When you click on a "Buy Now" link, you will be redirected to the retailer's website to complete your purchase. Any transaction you enter into with a third-party retailer is solely between you and that retailer.
                        </p>
